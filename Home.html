<h4>Elderly & live-in care</h4>
<p> Nursing homes are no longer the only option available to people requiring regular care. "Caring is Healing" 
is a leading provider of alternative live-in home care support to clients who’re elderly, disabled 
or in need of a little help getting back on their feet after accident or illness.
Our friendly, committed and trusted carers are specially-trained to assist clients in remaining as independent 
as possible, in the homes they know and love, with one-to-one, personalized care </p> <img src="">
<h4>Extra-care</h4>
<p>"Caring is Healing"’s Extra Care schemes strike an important balance for clients 
who require high levels of support but still want to maintain their independence and privacy.
Our schemes operate in purpose-built properties, providing accessible, safe 
housing for older people who are unable to live completely independently. Our skilled and 
highly-trained care assistant teams are on site 24/7, ready to provide support as and when it is required
</p>
<h4>Become a care assistant</h4>
<P>
  Care work offers some of the most rewarding opportunities to help and improve the lives of those that need it the most. As a care assistant, you’ll help with day-to-day chores around the home, personal 
care, meal preparation and even be a companion to a wide variety of people, from elderly clients to disabled young people.
While certainly hard at times, you’ll enjoy the satisfaction of making a real difference to a person’s life. Find out more about what it takes to be a care assistant, the training involved to be a carer and see our latest vacancies
